However, increased appreciation of the important role of hybridization as an evolutionary process has caused a re-evaluation of these policies. Determining whether hybridization is natural or anthropogenic is crucial for conservation, but is often difficult [@Allendorf2022].\n\n## Hybridization\n\n![Microsatellite gel image showing genotype profiles (locus Lc106) for 10 lynx, 10 bobcat, and three putative hybrids.

Clarification of relatedness, taxonomy and phylogeny among populations.\n\n-   The most basic question in conservation biology: how many species are there?\n-   Assessing the taxonomy of one population or species still remains one of the most important applications of conservation genetics.\n-   Until 1970 various taxonomic units were classified using morphological features.\n-   In 1973 the Endangered Species Act (ESA, US Gov.) extended legal protection to species and subspecies.\n\n> When taxonomic distinction became the basis for legal protection...the innocence was lost forever [@Obrien1996].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2. Determination of population management units based on genetic criteria.\n\n-   On what basis we delimit meaningful management units in the wild?\n\n-   The genetic differences as measured by the $F_{ST}$ statistics provide an objective criterion for defining population management units.\n\n-   Combining nuclear and mtDNA markers it was possible to identify 4 demographically autonomous population units of *Elephas maximus*, a northeastern India unit, a central India unit, and 2 genetically distinct unit in the south of India to be administrered separately because of their genetic uniqueness. These units were radically different from what had been proposed solely on the political considerations [@Vidya2005].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3. Estimation of gene flow and dispersal among populations.\n\n-   Managing gene flow between populations, through a detailed analysis of $F_{ST}$ patterns, can help to better understand and define the individuals that could be used in translocation projects, when to do so, and the duration of the whole translocation process [@Allendorf2022].\n\n-   Consideration about gene flow rates are extremely important in the management of wild plant and animal populations.\n\n-   @Dolan1999 indirectly estimated gene flow measuring the genetic differentiation of three rare species of perennial scrubs in Florida. In one of them, *Hypericum cumulicola*, gene flow was absent. The limited genetic variation detected in this species limits the adaptive response of it to future environmental changes and makes it more prone to extinction.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4. Determination of the time since past genetic bottlenecks.\n\n![Each point shown represents a population and the vertical segment represents the age of its associated founder event where the segment length is proportional to the founder age [@Tournebize2022].](./class_13_23.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5. Understanding patterns of reproductive ecology.\n\n![Structure graphical output for two syntopic iguana species from the GalÃ¡pagos islands [@DiGiambattista2018].](./class_13_24.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Adapted from @MacLeod2015.](./class_13_25.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 6. Locating original sources of wildlife products.\n\n-   The International Whaling Commission (IWC) imposed a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982 [@Allendorf2022].\n\n-   A small quota of very specific species of whales was still available to countries like Japan and South Korea.\n\n> The source of these products was assumed to be undocumented \\`incidental takes' from fisheries' by-catch, although we cannot exclude the possibility of illegal hunting or smuggling. The demographic impact of this undocumented exploitation was evaluated using the model of population dynamics adopted by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission. For the range of exploitation consistent with the market sample, this protected stock was predicted to decline towards extinction over the next few decades [@Baker2000].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Managing genetic diversity in wild populations\n\n-   The IUCN lists the common adder, *Vipera berus*, in the category [Least Concern](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/47756146/743903). It has a very widespread distribution, although populations are fragmented in small and often isolated demes.\n\n-   One isolated population of this species, in Sweden, declined in 1960s and then began to exhibit the a high proportion of deformed and stillborn offspring coupled with low genetic variability, i.e., signs of inbreeding depression [@Madsen1999].\n\n-   @Madsen1999 introduced 20 young adder individuals collected from larger and more genetically diverse population in this declining population. After only 4 years, the time needed for an adder to become reproductively active, started to document a reduction in still born babies and a reduction in deformities and an increase in genetic diversity.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Numbers of adult male Adders (*Vipera berus*) captured from 1981 to 2010 along the seashore at an isolated population just west of Smygehuk Village in southern Sweden. After @Madsen2011](./class_13_26.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Hybridization and introgression are two important factors to monitor in wild populations.\n\n-   When two closely related species coexist and one of them is more rare, the rare one risks to be genetically swamped due to hybridization and/or introgression (the incorporation of genetic material from a species/population/subpopulation into the genome of another) [@Allendorf2022].\n\n-   A very well documented example of managing genetic problems in wildlife population comes from the red wolf (*Canis rufus*) from south-central United States.\n\n-   In 1975 red wolf became extinct in the wild [@Avise1996]. The united States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) initiated a campaign to re-establish a population of this species using captive-bred individuals.\n\n-   Released individuals became established and that area was designed as the Red Wolf Experimental Population Area (RWEP-A).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   The biggest threat was not much the hybridization between red wolves and coyotes (*Canis latrans*), but the backcrossing between $F_1$ hybrids and adult red wolf individuals (i.e., introgression).\n\n![After @Fredrickson2006](./class_13_27.png)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Managing genetic diversity in captive populations\n\n-   Attempts at turkey reintroduction using captive bred individuals were a failure in 95% of cases in the united States [@Allendorf2022].\n\n-   As @Leopold1944 said:\n\n> Wild turkey are wary and shy, which are advantageous characteristics in eluding natural and human enemies. The hens and young ones automatically react to threats in ways that are self protective...Birds of the domestic strain, on the other hand, are differently adapted. Many of their physiological reaction and psychological characteristics are favorable to existence in the barnyard but may perclude existence in the wild.\n\n-   The problem stated above is present in every single population and it is known as *adaptation to captivity* [@Allendorf2022].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   The more accustomed wild animals become to their artificial environment the less likely they are to survive when reintroduced in the wild.\n\n-   Lifetime reproductive success of and overall fitness of stealhead trout (*Oncorhynchus mykiss*) declined precipitously in just two generations of captivity [@Araki2007].\n\n-   The data provided in @Araki2007 suggest that 37.5% fitness decline per captive reared generation demonstrating that genetic adaptation (GA) to captivity is something dangerous that should not be underestimated.\n\n-   GA can be mathematically described:\n\n$$\n\\label{ga}\n\\tag{8.1}\nGA = \\frac{Sh^2}{L}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\frac{y}{L}}[1-\\frac{1}{2N_e}]^{\\frac{y}{L}}(1-m_i)\n$$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Where $S$ is the selection differential in captivity (the strength in selection for captive traits).\n-   $h^2$ is heritability (additive genetic variation for reproductive fitness).\n-   $y/L$ number of generations in captivity ($y$ = years, $L$ = generation length).\n-   $N_e$, you should recognize this one....\n-   $m_i$ proportion of genetic material coming from immigrants.\n\n## What could we do to minimize GA?\n\n-   Reduce the amount of time in captivity (i.e., reduce the number of iterations $\\sum_{i=1}^{y/L}$).\n-   Reduce the strength of selection, $S$, in captivity. Very complicated, as it entails making the captive environment as similar as possible to the natural environment, both at the biotic and the abiotic level.\n-   Add more immigrants (unrelated individuals) from wild or captive populations to slow the rate of genetic adaptation.\n\nUnderstanding the intentions, methods and scope of the management plans is essential if we want to grasp the way in which captive populations are integrated into worldwide conservation strategies today [@Allendorf2022].\n\n\n## Heritability\n\n-   The heritability of a character is probably the most important determinant of individuals to evolve in response to selection!\n\n-   Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a population due to genetic differences that parents can pass through offspring in the next generation.\n\n-   Heritability is symbolized $h^2$, but the superscript has no mathematical meaning!\n\n-   Molecular measures of genetic diversity do not often answer some of the questions we try to address in conservation genetics as correlation between molecular and quantitative measures of genetic diversity are low.\n\n-   The heritability associated with quantitative characters that are related to reproductive fitness are of great interests to conservation biologists.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Distribution of phenotypes for 5 quantitative characters that are very important for reproductive fitness. After @Frankham2010](./class_13_28.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Quantitative traits are influenced by mani loci plus environmental influences (feeding, exposure to sunlight, water availability et. etc. etc.).\n\n-   It is not possible to directly infer genotype from phenotype only when we refer to quantitative characters, and individuals with the same phenotype may have different genotypes, or individuals with the same genotypes may have different phenotype.\n\n-   Genetic diversity for quantitative characters in outbred populations is due to the segregation of multiple mendelian loci referred to as Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL).\n\n-   QTLs possess alleles that add to or detract from the magnitude of the quantitative character.\n\n-   How do we measure what portion of the phenotypic variance for quantitative traits derives from genetic variation among individuals?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.  Variation within and among populations.\n2.  Comparison of inbred with outbred populations.\n3.  Resemblance among relatives.\n\n-   Because of the great impact that the environment can have on the expression of quantitative traits characters it is extremely important that all comparisons are carried out in a controlled situation and synchronously (i.e., at the same time): common garden experiment.\n\n---\n\nWhen talking about phenotypes we have mentioned that a measurable phenotype is the consequence of the underlying genotypes inherited by the parents plus the influence of the environment. We can represent this relation in mathematical terms in the following way:\n\n$$\n\\label{p}\n\\tag{8.2}\nP = G + E\n$$\n\nwhere $P$ = phenotye, $G$ = genotype, and $E$ = environment. Being able to distinguish between the genetic and the environmental component in this interaction is important to understand the evolutionary trajectory of a population or species [@Frankham2010].\n\nDifferent phenotypes within a population, also known as phenotypic variance $V_P$, represents the sum total of all the interactions between the genotypic variance, $V_G$, the environmental variance, $V_E$, and the interaction term between these two quantities, $G*E$.\n\n$$\n\\label{Vp}\n\\tag{8.3}\nV_P = V_G + V_E + 2Cov_{GE}\n$$\n\n---\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Quantitative genetic variation for corolla length in tobacco. After @Strickberger1985.](./class_14_7.jpg){width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   Variances for corolla length in the two homozygous parent population are 48 and 32 respectively.\n-   Variance in the $F_1$ population is 46, while variance in the $F_2$ population is 130.5.\n-   The variances in the parental and $F_1$ populations are due solely on environmental variance, $V_E$.\n-   We can average the three separate estimates of $V_E = \\frac{48+32+46}{3}=42$.\n-   In $F_2$ we need to account for both genetic variation and environmental variation: $V_{F_2} = V_G+V_E = 130.5$, and we can rearrange the equation as $V_G = V_{F_2} - V_E = 130.5- 42 = 88.5$.\n:::\n:::::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Based on the previous example, we can conclude that in $F_2$ generation $88/130.5 = 68\\%$ of variance is due to segregation of polymorphic loci while only $100-68=32\\%$ of the total phenotypic variance is due to environmental factors ($V_E$).\n-   In common garden experiment the covariance term in equation \\ref{p} can be kept under control by standardizing the experimental condition for the animal or plant under study.\n-   This is way more complicated to obtain in wild populations as the there is no easy way to keep under control the many environmental variables that play into the reproductive fitness of individuals.\n\n. . .\n\n### Further partitioning $V_G$\n\nWe can further divide the genetic variance in three subcomponents: additive genetic variance ($V_A$), dominance variance ($V_D$) and interacting variance ($V_I$).\n\n$$\n\\label{Vg}\n\\tag{8.4}\nV_G= V_A+V_D+V_I\n$$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   $V_A$ reflects variation in the avergae effect of the many loci involved in the overall genotypic variance. This measure, and in particular the ratio $V_A/V_P$ (also known as heritability) reflects the evolutionary potential of the population or species under study [@Frankham2010].\n-   $V_D$ measures variation in dominance deviation.\n-   $V_I$ is a measure of epistasis, i.e. the variation in interaction deviations among genes. This can also be interpreted as a measure of the effects of outbreeding, whether beneficial or deleterious [@Frankham2010].\n\n. . .\n\n-   To better understand the meaning of $V_A$ and $V_D$ we can work a simple model to help illustrate how we can partition the genetic variance in its component, in particular the additive and the dominant ones ($V_A$ and $V_D$)!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![Genotypic values assigned to three genotypes at a locus along with their frequencies with random mating [@Frankham2010]](./class_15_1.jpg)\n\n. . .\n\n![Genotypic values for additive, dominant and overdominant loci [@Frankham2010]](./class_15_2.jpg)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   In Merino sheep the $B$ allele increases the litter size. Based on some experimental studies we can compute the following average litter size for the three distinct genotypes:\n\n| BB   | Bb   | bb   |\n|------|------|------|\n| 2.66 | 2.17 | 1.48 |\n\n-   We can now compute the value of $a$ as:\n\n$$\na = \\frac{BB \\ value- bb \\ value}{2} = \\frac{2.66-1.48}{2}=0.59\n$$\n\n-   Based on our model, the mid-point between the two homozygotes is the zero point on the scale of genotypic values, and we can use it to determine $d$. It is calculated as $(2.66-0.59 = 2.07)$. We can now calculate the dominance deviation $d$ as:\n\n$$\nd= Bb \\ value - mid \\ point = 2.17-2.07=0.10\n$$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Each copy of the $B$ allele increases the litter size by an average of 0.59 offspring and this allele presents partial dominance with the heterozygote having 0.10 offspring above the $bb$ homozygote.\n\n. . .\n\n### Focusing on additive genetic variance ($V_A$)\n\n![Genotypic values assigned to three genotypes at a locus along with their frequencies with random mating [@Frankham2010]](./class_15_1.jpg)\n\n-   For a polymorphic locus with addivie effects ($d = 0$) and genotypic frequncies and values as in the above example, the additive genetic variation is defined as $V_A = 2pqa^2$.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   We can desume that $V_A$ is directly dependent on the heterozygosity (2pq) and half the difference in genotypic values between the two homozygotes ($a$).\n-   The larger the difference between the two homozygotes the larger $V_A$.\n-   On the other end, when $d \\ne 0$ (there is dominance) the additive genetic variation can be computed as:\n\n$$\n\\label{vadom}\n\\tag{8.5}\nV_A = 2pq[a+d(q-p)]^2\n$$\n\n-   Thus, $V_A$ also depends on the dominance deviation!\n\n-   As you can guess, $V_A$ of a specific character depends on the combined effect of all segregating loci in a population with effect on the specific quantitative character under study [@Frankham2010].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Heritability and Evolutionary potential\n\n-   Heritability determines the extent to which a character is passed on from parents to offspring. Only traits that are heritable will be passed on from generation to generation. A trait that is favorable, but it is not heritable will not be passed on!\n\n-   Heritability ($h^2$) is defined as the proportion of total phenotypic variation due to additive genetic variance:\n\n$$\n\\label{h2}\n\\tag{8.6}\nh^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}\n$$\n\n-   $h^2$ value ranges from $0$ to $1$, with $0$ characteristic of highly inbred populations with no genetic variation, and $1$ expected in traits with basically no environmental variance components and all additive genetic variance.\n-   Heritability can not be extrapolated for environments that are not native to population or species under study.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Quantitative variation is characterized using statistical parameters including means, variances, covariances, regressions and correlations [@Frankham2010].\n\n. . .\n\n| Parent means (P) | Offspring means (O) |\n|------------------|---------------------|\n| 6.8              | 7.3                 |\n| 6.9              | 7.4                 |\n| 7.1              | 7.6                 |\n| 7.3              | 7.5                 |\n| 7.3              | 7.3                 |\n| 7.3              | 7.2                 |\n| 7.4              | 7.4                 |\n| 7.5              | 7.7                 |\n| 7.5              | 7.6                 |\n\nData from [@Murray1968].\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Mean: $\\bar{P}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n P_i}{n}$ and $\\bar{O}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n O_i}{n}$\n\n\n-   Variance: $V_{P}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (P_i-\\bar{P})^2}{n-1}$ and $V_{O}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (O_i-\\bar{O})^2}{n-1}$\n\n-   Standard deviations: $sd_{P} = \\sqrt{V_{P}}$ and $sd_{O} = \\sqrt{V_{O}}$\n\n\n-   Covariance ($Cov_{PO}$) measures the extent to which they vary in concert ($+$), they vary independently ($0$), or in opposition ($-$): $Cov_{PO} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (P_i-\\bar{P})(O_i-\\bar{O})}{n-1}$\n\n\n-   Correlation ($r_{PO}$) is a standardized measure of how two measurements vary in concert.
