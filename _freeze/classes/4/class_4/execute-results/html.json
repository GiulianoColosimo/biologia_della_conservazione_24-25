The process of extinction hardly happens over night, and is usually preceded by population decline [@VanDyke2020]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Population models\n\n-   The simplest model of population dynamic can be written as the sum of births (B) and migrants entering the populations (I) minus mortality (D) and individuals leaving or exiting the population (E)\n\n$$\n\\label{popmod}\n\\tag{4.1}\nN_{(t+1)} = N_{(t)} + (B_t + I_t) - (D_t + E_t)\n$$\n\n. . .\n\n-   If a population is increasing exponentially (i.e., increasing with and increasing rate over time) its growth will be defined by $N$ and a rate of increase $r$ which is rate of birth minus rate of death ($r = b-d$)\n-   Without considering migration (neither in nor out of the population) $B$ becomes a function of birth rate ($b$) and the population size $N$\n-   Similarly, the number of deaths ($D$) is a function of $d$ the per capita death rate, and population size\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class_4_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n-   In exponential growth change in numbers over change in time is expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\label{expgrth}\n\\tag{4.2}\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN \n$$\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   The exponential growth curve is a good starting point, although unrealistic for most species\n-   A more realistic model should account for species' ecology and the fact that species exist in their environment\n-   The limits imposed by the environment are usually identified using $K$, i.e. the carrying capacity\n\n$$\n\\label{expgrthcc}\n\\tag{4.3}\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN (\\frac{K-N}{K})\n$$\n\n- With small values of $N$ relative to $K$, $(\\frac{K-N}{K}) \\approx 1$ and the population grows almost exponentially \n\n-   Changes in $N$ directly influence the growth rate of the population: [density dependence]{style=\"color: red;\"}!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](class_4_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n- This model assumes all individuals are demographic equivalent, an unlikely assumption in many systems, especially with long lived individuals!\n\n## Population perturbations\n\n### Density independent factors\n\n- Many factors influencing population size are described as [stochastic factors]{style=\"color: red;\"}\n\n- A population whose growth is only a function of stochastic variation can be described as density independent. @Shaffer1981 recognizes 4 main sources of such stochasticity:\n\n    - genetic stochasticity;\n    - demographic stochasticity;\n    - environmental stochasticity;\n    - natural catastrophes!\n\n- The effects of the above sources of population variation are not predetermined, but subject to uncertainties that are more or less probable according to specific characteristics of the population analysed\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Density dependent factors\n\n- Density dependent factors can regulate the size of a population in a much more precise way than density independent ones\n\n- To better understand these factors it is useful to debunk the assumptions of the logistic growth curves\n\n    - Time lag in density dependence: the addition of new individuals in the population may not have an immediate effect in shaping the growth curve\n\n    - Traditional logistic curves assume constant values of K: it is more accurate to define K not as a constant value that a population cannot exceed, but as a population size reflecting equilibrium between a population and its resources created by their interaction\n\n    - Individuals in a population are not contributing equally to the population growth:  age and sex structure play a pivotal role\n\n## How do we estimate the size of a population?\n\n-   It is often impractical and/or impossible to count every single individual in a population\n\n. . .\n\n-   Capture-Mark-Recapture experiments allow to estimate a population's size\n\n. . .\n\n-   Some individuals are captured and marked\n-   The marked individuals are released in their environment\n-   A second sampling trip is conducted and another portion of the individuals are collected\n-   The number of marked individuals collected in the second expedition is expected to be proportional to the number of marked individuals in the entire population\n-   It is important to have sufficient time between sampling occasions, to allow for the marked individuals to redistribute themselves among the unmarked population\n\n## Tagging systems\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   A tagging system is a system allowing us to tag and label things to provide those things a unique identifier\n-   People have been tagging animals (wild and captive) for hundreds of years and have developed different ways to tag pretty much every single living things\n-   An animal tag can be as simple as a piece of metal or plastic with a number carved on it or with a standardized meaning\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![A male *Cyclura carinata* with colored bead tags.

He postulated that because of the reduced population size of deer in British natural reserves they may experience loss of vigor [@Darwin1896]\n-   The modern concern for genetics in conservation began in the 1970s when Frankel began to raise the alarm about the loss of primitive crop varieties and their replacement by genetically uniform cultivars [@Frankel1970; @Frankel1974]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Most articles dealing with conservation and genetics fit into one of the five general categories [@Allendorf2022]:\n\n     1. Management and reintroduction of captive populations, and the restoration of biological communities\n\n     2. Description and identification of individuals, genetic population structure, kin relationships, and taxonomic relationships\n\n     3. Detection and prediction of the effects of habitat loss, fragmentation, isolation, and genetic rescue\n\n     4. Detection and prediction of the effects of hybridization and introgression\n\n     5. Understanding the relationships between fitness of individuals or local adaptation of populations and environmental factors\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   As in other sciences, conservation genetics has benefited from the use of model organisms for experiments as well as modelistic and numerical approaches\n-   How much gene flow is required to prevent the inbreeding effects of small population size?\n    -   We can use species with short generation time and easy to control (*Drosophila*, peas, *Arabidopsis thaliana*) to make empirical experiments and answer the above question\n-   Describing individuals from a molecular genetic standpoint can also help to better understand the basic biology of species and populations [@Allendorf2022]\n    -   Total population size can be estimated from the genotypes in populations that are difficult to sample with the classic methodologies [@Luikart2010]\n-   Genetic analysis can help detecting cryptic effects of climate change on the distribution of species [@Allendorf2022]\n    -   @Gurgel2020 documented the reduction in genetic diversity after a heatwave despite the sea weed population had recovered\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Interacting factors in conservation of natural populations.

The Tuatara case from New Zealand is paradigmatic [@Daugherty1990; @Gemmell2020]\n-   @VaneWright1991 developed a method to assign a conservation value to distinct phylogenetic lineages. This value is inversely proportional to the number of branching points to other extant lineages\n\n### Species or ecosystems\n\n> Conservation requires a balanced approach based on habitat protection that also takes into account the natural history and viability of individual species. This is particularly challenging for wide-ranging species [@Allendorf2022].\n\n-   The case of Chinook salmon and killer whales [@Groskreutz2019]\n\n### Populations or species\n\n-   Genetically distinct populations should probably receive more attention than species from a conservation perspective\n-   The functional units of an ecosystem are populations\n-   Experiments conducted in the field of community genetics hint towards a correlation between individual alleles within species and community composition and diversity [@Crutsinger2016]\n-   Genetic variation of a Tasmanian blue gum tree affects the distribution of insects, birds, and marsupials [@Whitham2008]\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Conservation genetics ultimately looks for and tries to maintain the [allelic diversity]{style=\"color: red;\"} within a population\n\n::: callout-important\n# Question\n\nWhat are alleles?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n::: callout-tip\n# Answer\n\nAlleles are different forms of the same gene! The number of alleles for a certain gene in a population is a measure of the genetic diversity of that specific population\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n-   Another goal of conservation genetics is that to prevent the fixation of alleles! When an allele is fixed (i.e., its frequency is 1) it means that:\n    -   there is no more variation at that specific gene\n    -   the population could experience fitness loss if the fixed allele is deleterious and it is found together with other deleterious mutations\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Fundamental vocabulary\n\n| Term | Definition |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Locus | The term refers both to the position on the chromosome where a specific gene is found, and, in general, to any genetic segment, even a single nucleotide base, of interest. An example of a locus could be the cytochrome oxidase sub-unit I gene (generally called COI), or the nucleotide base at position 350 on a specific sequence. |\n| Allele | Variant of a specific locus on homologous chromosomes (containing the same type of genetic information). |\n| Genotype | Combination of alleles at one or more loci (genes) in an individual. For example, the genotype of a diploid individual characterized for the bi-allelic gene A might be A1A1, A1A2, or A2A2. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|   | (continues) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Phenotype | The obvious and measurable manifestation of a specific genotype. |\n| Genome | The set of nucleotide sequences, coding and not, generally organized into chromosomes, which characterize a species or an individual. |\n| Homozygote | Individual with two identical copies of a specific allele registered at the locus (gene) of interest. |\n| Heterozygote | Individual with two different alleles characterized at the locus (gene) of interest. |\n| Allele frequency | The frequency of a specific allele in a population. The term gene frequency is often used to indicate the same concept. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|   | (continues) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Polymorphic | The presence in a species or population of 2 or more alleles at a certain gene. For example, gene A in a population might have 4 alleles: A1, A2, A3, and A4. A locus is considered polymorphic if the frequency of its most frequent allele is less than 0.99 or 0.95. |\n| Monomorphic | A population or species is monomorphic for a gene when all individuals have the same allele. In other words, the frequency of that allele in the population is 1. |\n| Average heterozygosity | Average number of heterozygous loci in an individual or population. |\n| Co-dominance | Situation where all genotypes can be identified by their phenotypes. In the case of gene A with two codominant alleles, the A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2 genotypes all produce different and distinguishable phenotypes. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|   | (continues) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Allelic diversity | Mean number of alleles per locus. |\n| Genetic distance | A measure of distance obtained by comparing 2 or more nucleotide sequences or by comparing the allele and genotype frequencies of two or more individuals or populations. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Molecular techniques\n\n![Figure reproduced from @Allendorf2022](./molmarkers.png)\n\n## Fundamental measures of genetic diversity\n\n-   Polymorphism\n\n$$\nP = number\\ of\\ polymorphic\\ loci/total\\ number\\ of\\ loci\n$$\n\n-   Allele frequency (for diploid individuals)\n\n$$\np = \\frac{2n_{Hom} + n_{Het}}{2n}\n$$ where $p$ is the frequency of the allele (usually the dominant one) and $n$ is the number of individuals that are homozygotes ($n_{Hom}$) and heterozygotes ($n_{Het}$) for that allele, respectively\n\n-   Average heterozygosity $H = \\sum H_i/N$ where $H_i$ is the average heterozygosity at locus $i$, and $N$ is the total number of loci\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Describing the genetic variation using mathematical tool is a good and necessary exercise, but it is not enough!\n-   We need to develop models that could tell us about how various evolutionary factors (natural selection, mutations, population size, geographic fragmentation, drift) affect the persistence of populations and species\n\n> Models are essential for understanding the genetics of natural populations in a variety of ways: *i)* models make us define the parameters that need to be considered; *ii)* models allow us to test hypotheses; *iii)* models allow us to generalize results; iv) models allow us to predict how a system will operate in the future [@Allendorf2022, p.95].\n\n-   As a general rule of thumb, models that we develop to understand natural populations should be as simple as possible\n    -   Simpler models are easier to reject, and, therefore, are more useful\n    -   Simple models are likely to be more general and therefore more applicable to a wider number of situations [@Allendorf2022, p.95]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## The simpler model: Hardy-Weinberg principle\n\n-   In 1908, Godfrey Harold Hardy (a British mathematician) and Wilhelm Weinberg (a German physician), independently developed a math model describing the dynamics of a diploid, sexually reproducing population\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Gregory Harol Hardy, figure from the Wiki page](./hardy.jpg)\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![Wilhelm Weinberg, figure from <http://www.esp.org/people/>](./weinberg.jpg)\n:::\n:::::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-   Hardy-Weinberg model suggests that a population reaches an equilibrium where allele frequencies are constant and there is a specific relation between genotypic and allelic frequencies\n\n. . .\n\nAssumptions of the model:\n\n| Assumption | Significance |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Random mating | Individuals show no significant preference or dislike for other individuals with respect to specific traits or loci. |\n| No mutation | Mutation is one of the few forces creating variability. We assume that the information is transmitted from generation to generation without the influence of mutation. |\n| Infinite population size | No population in nature is actually infinite (although populations of some species may as well be)! This assumption is fundamental to construct a null model and compare the effect of small population size. |\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|   | (continues) |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| No natural selection | We will assume that all alleles and genotypes have the same fitness and that there is no differential reproduction or survival. This assumption is very unlikely to be true in nature, especially because selection may be reduced for the loci under analysis, but still present at all other loci in an individual. |\n| No immigration | We will first consider a situation where only one population of a certain species is present. This means that we will not consider gene flow and exchange of genetic material from and to other populations. |\n\n. . .\n\n::: callout-important\n# Question\n\nWhat is the main consequence of the assumptions we have just described?\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Organization of genetic variability in a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium population typed at a biallelic locus](class_4_files/figure-revealjs/hwProps-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## References\n",
