## Non-excludable and non-rival goods

-   Natural goods and resources have been proven hard for traditional economic theory
-   An [excludable good]{style="color: blue;"} or resource is one in which ownership of the resource permits the owner exclusive use of the resource and provides the owner with the ability to exclude others from its use
-   A [rival good]{style="color: blue;"} or service is one for which its uses infringes with someone else's ability to enjoy the same good or service
-   Many ecosystem goods and services are [non-excludable]{style="color: blue;"}. Can you exclude someone from breathing oxygen?
-   Some ecosystem and good services are also [non-rival]{style="color: blue;"}, in that the use of the good does not infringe on the use from other
-   Because of these characteristics (non-excludable and non-rival) these goods (like climate and water surfaces) are outside of the marketplace and are considered public goods

## 

-   The need for some form of governance for public goods arises when there is some degree of rivalry and when changes in land usage and management threatens non-excludability

-   Over exploitation of freshwater by one person or group in a discrete location may limit the availability of fresh water to other users at that same location, effectively changing it from a public good to a common pool resource

-   If a good is not excludable someone can use it whether or not any producer of the good allows it. If people can use the good regardless of whether or not they have to pay for it, they are considerably less likely to pay for it. If people are unwilling to pay for a good there will be no profit in its production and in a market no one will invest in it in a substantial way [@Daly2011]

## Fundamental assumptions of supply and demand

- Economists assume that consumers purchase the combination and quantity of goods that maximize their own well being (**utility**). Simultaneously, producers make rational decisions to provide such good based on potential for profitability
- Economic theory assumes that the market agents (producers and consumers) account for all potential costs (**opportunity costs**), given the consumer or producer's own resource restraints
- Based on this, economic analysis can figure out the maximum price **P** and individual with **Q** units of a good or service would be willing to pay for an additional unit (*marginal profit*) of that good or service
- Based on the same kind of analysis we can figure out the marginal cost of producing an additional unit (*marginal cost*)

- Supply and demand curve. Q = quantity; P = price; D = demand; S = supply. The market clearing price (or equilibrium price) is given at point (q1, p1). As the demand or supply shift, the market clears at a different price and quantity. In the graph example the demand shifts to the right as a response to seasonal  increase for a certain product

---

- The maximization of consumer and producer surplus, and the creation of economic efficiency, is expected to occur automatically without further intervention from the government or other institution

- An efficient market, then, is one that maximizes social welfare

- In this efficient market, current level of production allows society to derive the largest possible net benefit from the market

. . .

- Unfortunately, the market does not guarantee an equitable or fair distribution of goods production and/or consumption across all participating in the market

- Ecosystem goods and services represent an example of **market failure**, where the market does not fully represent social values due to externalities and the true costs and benefits of an activity or good are not linked to consumer or producer decision making

- A classic example of negative externalities is air pollution where some economic costs, social costs, and environmental costs are born by many other people beyond, and often not including, the power plant owners

## Supply and demand with ecosystem service

- To date most soil conservation service studies heavily focus on measuring soil conservation service supply from the natural system without considering corresponding beneficiaries (i.e. demand), and feedback from the human system

- In this paper, the authors present an updated soil conservation service assessment framework as a two-way analysis of supply and demand, identifying the impacts of soil conservation on human wellbeing and the feedback of human activities on soil conservation supply observed at different scales, from local (intracoupling) to regional (telecoupling)

. . .

### Introduction

- Soil erosion has the potential to change soil structure, negatively affects soil fertility and poses a threat to food security and can ultimately affect teh carbon cycle

- Human activities have exacerbated an otherwise natural process

- Soil conservation service, *the capacity of ecosystem to prevent soil loss*, is receiving more and more attention 

---

- **R**evised **U**niversal **S**oil **L**oss **E**quation (**RUSLE**) provides information on soil conservation capacities and is the method of choice to estimate soil conservation service

. . .

### Premises of the article 

- The challenge for soil conservation service assessment is on how to measure such service for its beneficiaries. Therefore, further studies are required to identify the corresponding beneficiaries or benefiting areas and to build a feedback between nature and human system, in order to understand the impacts of changes on soil conservation supply to human well-being, as well as on human demand to soil conservation supply

### Aims of the article

- To address the issues, the authors propose a soil conservation service assessment framework that combines supply and demand of the soil conservation service as an integrated function. Following the framework, the authors propose a new method to quantify soil conservation service supply and provide an overview about the supply and demand of soil conservation service from local to regional scale

- **E**cosystem **S**ervices (ESs) are the ecological characteristics, functions, or processes that directly or indirectly contribute to human wellbeing

- A crucial feature of ESs concept is the link between ecosystem and human well-being, which considers both the products/functions provided by ecosystem and the beneficiaries which derive benefits from the ecosystem

- As for **S**oil **C**onservation **S**ervice (**SCS**), the ecosystem has the capacity to control erosion and facilitate sedimentation, depending on ecosystem structure and land management, especially the existing vegetation cover and root system

- This capacity should be called the potential SCS supply provided by ecosystem. Only after people use this service supply to maintain agricultural productivity or to improve water quality, we can say that it is the actual SCS because the SCS provision is used by beneficiaries to meet people’s demand and to contribute to human wellbeing

- The authors present a framework  to couple the service supply from nature system and demands from human system

##

##

##

- After quantifying the supply of SCS, the next crucial step is to characterize the demand for the service, which involves three components: 
     1. identification of the beneficiaries and their location, 
     2. indicators to measure social-economic benefits
     3. link to connect the SCS with social-economic benefits

##

- During the research processes of soil conservation service, we also need to carry out two-way (feedback) analysis between human system and nature system

- Ecosystem management from human system will not only affect the target process, but also trigger possible unprecedented effects on the target processes and/or non-target processes 

- Grain for Green restoration project in Loess Plateau of China as a case study, human influences and multiple ecosystem processes have been interconnected, and ecosystem management have cascading impacts at multiscales

- At the local scale, ecosystem restoration can bring positive effect, such as soil conservation and C fixation.  Unfortunately, it also led to some unprecedented environmental problems, such as dried soil layer and water shortage. If these problems are prolonged, more negative effects may happen at larger spatial and time scale, such as vegetation degradation, regional water shortage, and downstream wetland degradation. The disturbance effects on ecosystem are transmuting from one type to another, including to types that have not been considered

### Main Conclusions

- The key feature of ecosystem service concept is a linkage between nature system and human system, as well as the bi-directional feedback between human and nature system via ecosystem service assessment

- The framework for metacoupling soil conservation demand and supply from local to regional scale identified and provided measures to consider the effects of soil conservation provision on human-wellbeing and the feedback of human activities at different scales

- Soil conservation services supply can be calculated as the maximum allowable erosion rate minus the current soil erosion rate, while soil conservation demand needs to consider defined targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals 

- Ecosystem management, such as ecosystem restoration project, will not only alter the target process, but also non-target processes, it may lead to unprecedented negative at different scales. Therefore, tradeoff analysis between soil conservation services and other ecosystems services at multiscales are necessary to understand the metacoupling soil conservation demand and supply

## Cost Benefit Analysis

-   Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is a tool used even in conservation economics
    -   Will we gain more than we loose in economic terms?
    -   What are our options?
    -   What if we do nothing?
-   The main issue in CBA is to clarify how to quantify costs and benefits
-   The Trump administration had long argued that the EPA (Environmental Protection Act), under the previous Obama administration overestimated the risk of various environmental regulation to the detriment of industry [@VanDyke2020]
-   For example, Trump's EPA had initially calculated that replacing Obama's Clean power Plan, with his proposed Affordable Clean Energy Act (CEA), would result in an additional 1400 deaths per year. His administration proposed a new set of rules to calculate CBA and this number was drastically reduced

## 

-   In Microeconomics there are two general classes of evaluation techniques for putting a price tag on ecosystem services or nature in general: **revealed preference** and **stated preference**

-   **Revealed preference** use observed behavior such as market purchases to make inferences on values of goods and services
    - Hedonic valuation model for private property
    - Hedonic travel cost method

-   **Stated preference** methods ask people how much they are willing to pay for a non-market good or service. Stated preference approaches create hypothetical markets for environmental benefits where there are no current market prices
    - Contingent valuation
        - Willingness to pay
        - Willingness to accept
    - Choice experiments
