# Biodiversity

## Changing paradigm

-   One of the most pervasive environmental changes of recent history is the loss of Earth's diversity of life

-   This loss is a systemic problem embedded in the normal ways the human species lives on planet earth

-   Conservation biology origins were driven by studies and discoveries in basic sciences such as genetics and population dynamics, but soon became manifest in applied sciences like forestry, fisheries, wildlife management, and more

-   The traditional view of recent extinctions as a collection of tragic individual case histories was replaced by a conviction that the global extinction crisis was produced by the fundamental disruption of ecosystem processes

-   The extinction crisis created an urgency to develop an alternative concept and transition from loss of endangered species to loss of Biodiversity [@VanDyke2020]

## What is Biodiversity?

. . .

-   The structural and functional variety of life forms at genetic, population community and ecosystem levels [@Sandlund1992].

-   Genes and their variety of forms (alleles) are the most fundamental units at which biodiversity can be measured, and their are the basis for all other measures of diversity.

## Why should we care about Biodiversity?

-   A more diverse combination of species (biological community) or, in other words, a more biodiverse system...
    -   ... translates in to a more productive environment [@Hooper2005; @Duffy2009].
    -   ... produces a more resistant environment [@Tilman1997; @Naeem2000].
    -   ... produces a more resilient environment [@Wilsey2000].
    -   ... produces more stable ecosystem processes and a more stable environment in general [@Cardinale2012; @Vanmeerbeek2021].
    
. . .

-   A key concept when talking about Biodiversity is that of **emergence**. This occurs when a complex entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and emerge only when they interact in a wider whole [@WikiEmergence]

. . .    

-   [Biodiversity is essential for food security and nutrition and offers key options for sustainable livelihoods]{style="color: red;"} (Convention on Biological Diversity, <https://www.cbd.int>)

## Current status of biodiversity

![Current biodiversity on vertebrates according to @Hoffman2010](./6_biodivstatus.png)

## Causes of rapid decline in amphibians

![After @Stuart2004](./16_amphibiansdecline.jpeg)

## Main causes of biodiversity loss

1.  Habitat modification [@deBaan2013]
    -   Transformational effects
    -   Occupational effects
    -   Permanent effects
2.  Climate change (we will talk about this in a separate class)

. . .

### Transformational effects

Change in the way the land is used. For example, a prairie changed to become a soybean field. The land is still there, and the productivity in term of biomass may even be higher, but the system structure's is simplified and the chance to have a diverse group of species is lost

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Occupational effects

Colonization of areas that were previously human free. The human presence directly and indirectly affect the newly colonized system by removing resources, producing wastes, altering the landscape

<br/>

### Permanent effects

Areas can be disturbed in a more or less permanent way. Lumbering of a forest section in a specific area can be, with time and proper management, reversed and the forest could be reestablished. A prairie covered in asphalt to build a mall and a parking lot is probably lost for good

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Species concept in conservation

::: callout-note
Although as an applied concept we can measure it at multiple levels, the most widely used currency to measure and compare biodiversity across sites is SPECIES!
:::

. . .

| Species concept | Description | Reference |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------|:------------------|
| Typological Species Concept (TySP) | Defines species as distinct and fixed morphological types | Based on Plato's, Aristotele's, and, later, Christian philosophies |
| Evolutionary Species Concept (ESC) | A species is a lineage of ancestral descent which maintains its identity from other such lineages and which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate | [@Wiley1978] |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

|   |   | (continued) |
|:------------------|:---------------------------------|:------------------|
| Biological Species Concept (BSC) | Groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups | [@Mayr1942] |
| Phylogenetic Species Concept (PSC) | A species is the smallest diagnosable cluster of individual organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent | [@Cracraft1983] |
| Differential Fitness Species Concept (DFSC) | Groups of individuals with features that would have negative fitness effects in other groups and cannot regularly be exchanged between groups upon contact | [@Hausdorf2011] |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Important to conservation is the identification of operational units to be preserved (individuals, populations, species, etc. etc. etc.)

-   Conservationists, thus, not only work to preserve organisms, but also their ability to adapt and respond to environmental changes (i.e., the capability of individuals to give rise to new species in the future)

-   From this perspective, the PSC has become widely used by conservationists as it incorporates well defined tools (both scientific and normative) to define species

-   PSC showing more species (48%) and an associated decrease in population size and range [@Agapow2004]

-   The concept of Evolutionary Significant Units (ESU) aims at preserving both evolutionary potential and organisms. ESUs are based on criteria that are associated to genetic variation between and within populations [@Moritz1994]

## Measuring biodiversity

| Index | Formula | Terms |
|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| **Alpha diversity**: The diversity of species within an ecological community.  The number of different species (species richness) and their evenness (the species' relative abundance) | $H = - \sum_i^s \ p_i \ ln(p_i),$ \n$\ (i=1, 2, 3,...,s),$ \n$\ \ (0 \le H^{'}\le \infty)$ [@VanDyke2020] | $p_i$ = proportion of the total community abundance of the species $i$  |
| **Beta diversity**: Measure of diversity among communities. A measure of the gradient of species composition across a landscape | $S/\alpha-1$ [@Whittaker1975] | $S$ = number of species in the area; \n$\alpha$ = average number of species per site |
| **Gamma diversity**:  Biodiversity of species across larger landscape levels | $dS/dD[(g+l)/2]$ [@Cody1986]| $D$ = distance; $g$ = rate of species gain; $l$ = rate of species loss |

- We can workout the value for site 5:

$$
17+5+15+31+5 = 73
$$

$$
p_{species1} = 17/73 = 0.233

## Global prioritization strategies

![Spatial concordance of global biodiversity priorities and ecosystem service value (ESV). Increasing intensities of green and red represent, respectively, increasing rank ESV and increasing rank consensus biodiversity priority. White corresponds to low values for both variables, black to high values for both, and shades of gray to covarying values for both.

## How to support biodiversity in human modified landscapes?

1.  Prefer diversity in crops (polyculture) and land use (land-use mosaic).
2.  Encourage traditional agricultural practices over large-scale mechanized solutions.
3.  Monitor and maintain keystone structure or species from the environment.
4.  Maintain as much natural vegetation as possible.
5.  Expand protected areas to encompass species of significant value (keystone-species).
6.  Favor use of native species in gardens and cultivation.
7.  Maintain urban green areas.
8.  Discourage urban sprawl.
9.  Encourage appreciation and understanding of conservation goals among land users.

## Synthesis

-   Biodiversity is a core concept of conservation biology. Its usefulness is only valid if we are able to thoroughly measure it and define it mathematically.

-   Only with a clear understanding and measurement of biodiversity and its value we could use it in conservation studies, conservation laws and conservation policy.

-   Effective future research on biodiversity will not only keep on refining and finding new ways on how to measure it, but also understand the evolutionary and ecological processes that can contribute to its creation and maintainment.

-   The hope is to increasingly see biodiversity as a core concept of future local and international strategies for the conservation of nature.
