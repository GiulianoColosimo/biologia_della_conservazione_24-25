    "text": "Welcome to class! These web-pages contain all the information you need to accomplish your class work for the teaching module Biologia della Conservazione. This module is part of the integrated course of Evolution and Conservation.\nThis is a mandatory module for master level students enrolled in the “Biologia Ambientale” degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth 5 CFU for a total of 40 hours (i.e., 20 classes of 2 hours each) to be administered in person during the first semester of academic year 2024/2025. The first class will be on Monday, November 4, 2024.\n\n\nThe module introduces students to Conservation Biology, a synthesis and crisis discipline that uses approaches and methods from disciplines such as Ecology, Population biology, Population genetics, Molecular biology, and applies them to the conservation of species, intended as dynamic entities capable to respond to environmental changes. Criteria and principles for the adoption of the different conservation strategies are presented and discussed throughout the course. Moreover, the practical aspects of the various approaches are examined through the study and analysis of real cases, with particular reference to aspects linked to the research lines carried out and coordinated by the teacher.\nTopics covered during the course include: evolutionary genetics of natural populations; loss of genetic variability in small populations; inbreeding and decreased fitness; fragmentation of populations; definition and maintenance of evolutionary potential; population size (\\(N\\) and \\(N_e\\)) and its estimators; resolution of taxonomic uncertainties; genetic management of threatened species; adaptation to captivity; planning of head-start interventions and captive-breeding; the IUCN classification; criteria for conservation: species richness, rare species, endemisms; hotspot analysis; gap analysis; climate change; conservation technology; conservation economics.\n\n\n\nThe course aims at providing students with the most fundamental tools to understand, acknowledge, describe, and address problems related to the conservation of Biodiversity. By the end of the course the students should develop autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents are expected to develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes. Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline through the access to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAttendance is mandatory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead carefully!\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to periodically check this website to make sure he/she has the most updated information about the course schedule and content. The dates for the mid term and final exams will be published on this website later during the course of the semester!"

    "text": "The origins of conservation\nFor thousands of years humans have managed natural resources, but did not spend much time conserving them. Yet, humans have always appreciated the importance of preserving the natural environment.\n\n\nPlato (~427—348 b.c.), through the words of Critia, laments the bad conditions of the land that is no longer productive and rich how it used to be (“Crizia,” n.d.).\nJudaism extended the principle of the Sabbath to agricultural land (“La Bibbia—Leviticus 25:4—5,” n.d.).\nDuring the Song dynasty (China, 960—1279 AD) it was common practice to set aside fengshui (sacred) portions of the land, mostly forest, to help regulating spiritual and physical power. Modern china forgo this view.\n\n\n\nThese are all historical examples showing that the notion to manage our natural resources is well known and established in our species. And yet, we continuously seem to fail at conserving them."

This occurs when a complex entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and emerge only when they interact in a wider whole (Wikipedia contributors, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity is essential for food security and nutrition and offers key options for sustainable livelihoods (Convention on Biological Diversity, https://www.cbd.int)"

Algae blooming consumed vast amounts of oxygen in the oceans, suffocating many species.\nPermian-Triassic. 96% of life lost. Volcanic activity in Siberia put out massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bacteria began producing methane, another greenhouse gas. Large quantities of both gases warmed the planet and combined with earth’s water, making the ocean and rain acidic, creating a highly toxic environment for life.\nTriassic-Jurassic. 80% of life lost.

(Ordovician-Silurian 86%; Late Devonian 75%; Permian-Triassic 96%; Triassic-Jurassic 80%; Cretaceous. 65%; current number of species approx. 2.16 M; average life span for a species is 5 MY).\n\n\n. . .\n\n100-((1*0.86)+(1*0.75)+(1*0.96)+(1*0.80)+(1*0.65))\n\n[1] 95.98\n\n\n. . .\n\nThis means that 100% - 4% = 96% of all extinctions occurred outside the mass extinction events.\n\n. . .\n\nThe results from this little exercise are not so distant from what has been known in the scientific literature (Raup, 1991).\n\n. . .\n\nThese results tell us that extinction is a natural process.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf extinction is part of the natural process of evolution it should be possible to identify a background-extinction rate, i.e. the natural extinction rate during periods in between major extinction events.\nIf we can estimate a background-extinction rate it should also be possible to compare it across time to measure our current impact on biodiversity.\nThe value we just used (~5-10 MY) per species is a good approximation of the background extinction rate (Lawton & May, 1995) and falls under the categories of extinction rate intended as species survival rate.\nAnother way used to estimate extinction rate is based on the species-area estimate (Chisholm et al., 2018).\nOne of the estimate of extinction rate largely used is in million species years (MSY, Pimm, Raven, Peterson, Çağan, & Ehrlich, 2006).\n\n\n\nThe million species year extinction rate is based on the empirical estimate from known data on current extinction.\nIt tells us how many extinctions we should expect in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million.\nFor example, follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century and one should observe just one extinction (i.e., 1 E/MSY according to Pimm et al., 2006).\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion!\n\n\n\n1230 species of birds have been described since 1900. This cohort has accumulated 98334 species-years, meaning that one species has been known for 80 years. Since their description, 13 have gone extinct. Can you estimate the extinction rate?\n\n\n. . .\n\n(13*10^6)/98334\n\n[1] 132.2025\n\n\n. . .\nThis means that the rates of extinctions in recent times (at least since we can document extinctions as they happen) seems to be dramatically increased [1]!\n\n\nThe core idea is to find a background extinction rate that doesn’t consider the influence of mass-extinction events and/or anthropic influence.\nWe know from fossil records that species seem to persist ~1 MY. Pimm, Russell, Gittleman, & Brooks (1995) take the fossil evidence and turn it into a background extinction rate (i.e, a ratio between two quantities, the number of species extinct over time-species). In particular, 1 extinction (E) per \\(10^6\\) species-years (MSY).\n\n. . .\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{10000}=\\frac{1}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{10^6}*10000;\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 0.01\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{98334}=\\frac{x}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13}{98334}*10^6;\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 132.202\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{191}{100000}=\\frac{x}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{191}{10^5}*10^6;\n\\]\n\\[\nx=1910\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overarching driver of species extinction is human population growth and per-capita consumption!\n\n1690 Dodo bird (Raphus cucullatus), extinct from predation by introduced pigs and cats.\n1768 Stellar’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), extinct from hunting for fur and oil.\n1870 Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius), extinct from human competition for mussels and other shellfish.\n1900 Rocky mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus), extinct from habitat conversion to farmland.\n1936 Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus cynocephalus), extinct from hunting, habitat loss, and competition with dogs.\n1952 Deepwater cisco fish (Coregonus johannae), extinct from competition and predation by introduced fishes.\n\n\n\n1962 Hawaii chaff flower (Achyranthes atollensis), extinct from habitat conversion to military installations.\n1989 Golden toad (Incilius periglenes), extinct from climate change or other impacts.\n2004 St. Helena olive tree (Nesiota elliptica), extinct from logging and plantations.\n\n(List available from the Smithsonian website.)\n\n\n\nA documented example of the impact of introduced species on island environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Smith, May, Pellew, Johnson, & Walter (1993).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Conservation Biology?\nNature conservation: priority-setting needs a global change"

This method works because if gene flow (\\(Nm\\)) is low, populations will have numerous private alleles that arise through mutation, for example.\nThe time during which a new allele remains private depends only on migration rates, such that the proportion of alleles that are private decreases as migration rate increases. If gene flow is high, private alleles will be uncommon (Allendorf et al., 2022).\nThis method could be less biased than the \\(F_{ST}\\)-island model method, when using highly polymorphic markers, because it apparently is less sensitive to problems of homoplasy created by back mutations than is the \\(F_{ST}\\) method (Allen, Amos, Pomeroy, & Twiss, 1995)."

    "text": "What is a PVA?\n\n\nLike the more usual forms of risk analysis applied to issues of public health and safety, PVA attempts to estimate the likelihood of future events based on currently available data and theory, both of which contain some degree of uncertainty (Shaffer, 1981).\n\n\n\n\nA more precise definition of PVA is provided by R. C. Lacy (1993), according to which a PVA is the estimation of extinction probabilities using analyses that incorporate identifiable threats to population survival in to models of the extinction process.\nTo accomplish, measure, and communicate the goals of evaluating extinction risks and estimating population persistence, PVAs generate viability measures that quantify different characteristics of a studied population essential for its persistence (Dyke & Lamb, 2020)."

This is a useful mathematical model, but very unrealistic from the biological point of view.\nTo incorporate the array of possible variation that can influence population growth in nature stochastic models are better suited and incorporate elements that deterministic models do not (Dyke & Lamb, 2020)!\nFor example, stochastic models can incorporate climatic changes and environmental stochasticity (drought and wet years), or demographic stochasticity (unexpected changes in birth or death rates).\nFurther, stochastic models usually incoroporate the concept that natural population often have growth bounds related to the environmental carrying capacity (\\(K\\)), posing a limit beyond which the population cannot grow.\nFinally, stochastic models can also incorporate probability values for uncommon and usually catastrophic events (Dyke & Lamb, 2020)."

    "text": "Policy initiative against climate change and favoring conservation\n\nWith the availability of spatial tools, modeling algorithm, increasing data collection, it is not a question of whether we should engage in climate informed conservation, but of which tools to apply under what conditions and to which species conditions (Tingley, Darling, & Wilcove, 2014).\nAccording to Tingley et al. (2014), it could be possible to classify conservation actions as either fine-filter or coarse-filter, with a portfolio of strategies that can be implemented. The authors further use the metaphor of a theater to better explain the rationale behind chosing a stratey that would save the actors or the stage.\nDecision on what are the best strategies to use depends on the answers to three key management questions: Where? When? Why?"

Most of the fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice sheets, which means that only a relatively small portion is available to sustain human, plant and animal life.\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these has a greater effect on global sea level?\n\nMelting sea ice\nMelting land ice\na and b combined\nExtreme precipitation events\nNone of the above\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb)\n\n\n\nSea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Melting sea ice does not contribute nearly as much to ocean water volume because floating ice displaces water in an amount equal to its volume. Some coastal regions and island nations have begun to experience the consequences of sea level rise. Rising seas not only affect dwellings and infrastructure, but fresh water is also affected as rising saltwater begins to contaminate it through “saltwater intrusion.”\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements of Earth’s gravitational field permit topographic, or surface, mapping of the ocean floor.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nUndersea mountain ranges like the the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, chains of islands and sea mounts like the strand from Hawai’i Island past Midway to the Aleutian Islands chain, and deep sea trenches like the Japan Trench can be identified in data collected by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) spacecraft. The additional mass of rock that composes the undersea mountains and the lack of rock in trenches provide gravitational telltales that GRACE can detect.\n\n\n\n\nThe only current that makes an uninterrupted circle around the entire Earth without hitting land is the:\n\nGulf stream\nJapan current\nCalifornia current\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current\nMonsoons\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nOcean currents are driven by ocean winds and influenced by the “Coriolis effect.” Water flows along the current until it encounters land, where the Coriolis effect causes the current to rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the south. Most currents form “gyres,” or large systems of rotating ocean currents. The gyre’s rotational patterns draw in debris from across the ocean, while wind patterns push the trash toward the center, trapping it there. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, there is no land, which allows the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to travel around the globe uninterrupted.\n\n\n\n\nTides are caused by:\n\nThe wind\nEarthquakes\nThe moon’s gravitational pool\nThe gravitational pool of both the moon and the sun\nPeople swimming\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nBoth the sun and the moon influence tide rise and fall, which are caused by the gravitational attraction between the ocean and the moon as well as the ocean and the sun. “Centrifugal force” — the same force that pulls you backward on the teacup ride at Disneyland – is generated from Earth’s spin and is another factor that influences Earth’s tides.\n\n\n\n\nAbout how much of Earth’s surface is covered by clouds at any given time?\n\n\\(15\\%\\)\n\\(30\\%\\)\n\\(60\\%\\)\n\\(90\\%\\)\n\\(95\\%\\)\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nCovering most of the Earth at any given moment, clouds have a huge—but insufficiently understood—impact on climate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat effects do various aerosols have on the climate?\n\nReflect sunlight back in to space, cooling the planet\nProvide a platform for water droplets and ice crystals to form and develop in to cloud\nIncrease the brightness of clouds making them reflect more sunlight in to space\nAbsorb sunlight, heat the surrounding air and prevent cloud formation\nAll of the above\na, b, and c\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n\n\n\nThat’s part of what makes aerosols so hard to pin down in climate models. Various kinds of aerosols have various kinds of effects, both direct and indirect. As a direct effect, aerosols scatter sunlight back into space. As an indirect effect, they can either help or hinder the development of clouds, which in turn can either cool or warm the planet.\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter a cloud looks, the less pollution it contains.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nA given volume of pollution-rich cloud tends to have more numerous and smaller droplets than in more pristine clouds. The high number of small droplets provides more surfaces to reflect light, making the cloud appear brighter than a cloud consisting of fewer and larger droplets.\n\n\n\n\nDo clouds heat or cool Earth?\n\nHeat\nCool\nBoth heat and cool\nNeither heat nor cool\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nDifferent kinds of clouds at different altitudes play different roles in regulating Earth’s temperature. Wispy clouds at high altitudes tend to trap infrared radiation emitted by the sun-warmed Earth, which prevents it from escaping into space and warms the atmosphere. On the other hand, thick, low-lying clouds tend to cool the planet by shading Earth’s surface, reflecting sunlight back into space. Scientists are trying to determine how global warming will affect the balance we’ve been enjoying up to now."

    "text": "This is the link to the climate change quizzes!\n\n. . .\n\nMost of the Earth’s water is found in:\n\nThe earth’s interior\nThe atmosphere\nLakes and rivers\nThe ocean\nThe polar ice caps\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nMost of Earth’s water (\\(96.5\\%\\)) is saline, or salty, ocean seawater. Most of the fresh water is tied up in glaciers and ice sheets, which means that only a relatively small portion is available to sustain human, plant and animal life.\n\n\n\n\nWhich of these has a greater effect on global sea level?\n\nMelting sea ice\nMelting land ice\na and b combined\nExtreme precipitation events\nNone of the above\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb)\n\n\n\nSea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting land ice and the expansion of seawater as it warms. Melting sea ice does not contribute nearly as much to ocean water volume because floating ice displaces water in an amount equal to its volume. Some coastal regions and island nations have begun to experience the consequences of sea level rise. Rising seas not only affect dwellings and infrastructure, but fresh water is also affected as rising saltwater begins to contaminate it through “saltwater intrusion.”\n\n\n\n\nMeasurements of Earth’s gravitational field permit topographic, or surface, mapping of the ocean floor.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue\n\n\n\nUndersea mountain ranges like the the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, chains of islands and sea mounts like the strand from Hawai’i Island past Midway to the Aleutian Islands chain, and deep sea trenches like the Japan Trench can be identified in data collected by the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) spacecraft. The additional mass of rock that composes the undersea mountains and the lack of rock in trenches provide gravitational telltales that GRACE can detect.\n\n\n\n\nThe only current that makes an uninterrupted circle around the entire Earth without hitting land is the:\n\nGulf stream\nJapan current\nCalifornia current\nAntarctic Circumpolar Current\nMonsoons\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nOcean currents are driven by ocean winds and influenced by the “Coriolis effect.” Water flows along the current until it encounters land, where the Coriolis effect causes the current to rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the south. Most currents form “gyres,” or large systems of rotating ocean currents. The gyre’s rotational patterns draw in debris from across the ocean, while wind patterns push the trash toward the center, trapping it there. In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, there is no land, which allows the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to travel around the globe uninterrupted.\n\n\n\n\nTides are caused by:\n\nThe wind\nEarthquakes\nThe moon’s gravitational pool\nThe gravitational pool of both the moon and the sun\nPeople swimming\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd)\n\n\n\nBoth the sun and the moon influence tide rise and fall, which are caused by the gravitational attraction between the ocean and the moon as well as the ocean and the sun. “Centrifugal force” — the same force that pulls you backward on the teacup ride at Disneyland – is generated from Earth’s spin and is another factor that influences Earth’s tides.\n\n\n\n\nAbout how much of Earth’s surface is covered by clouds at any given time?\n\n\\(15\\%\\)\n\\(30\\%\\)\n\\(60\\%\\)\n\\(90\\%\\)\n\\(95\\%\\)\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nCovering most of the Earth at any given moment, clouds have a huge—but insufficiently understood—impact on climate.\n\n\n\n\nWhat effects do various aerosols have on the climate?\n\nReflect sunlight back in to space, cooling the planet\nProvide a platform for water droplets and ice crystals to form and develop in to cloud\nIncrease the brightness of clouds making them reflect more sunlight in to space\nAbsorb sunlight, heat the surrounding air and prevent cloud formation\nAll of the above\na, b, and c\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne)\n\n\n\nThat’s part of what makes aerosols so hard to pin down in climate models. Various kinds of aerosols have various kinds of effects, both direct and indirect. As a direct effect, aerosols scatter sunlight back into space. As an indirect effect, they can either help or hinder the development of clouds, which in turn can either cool or warm the planet.\n\n\n\n\nThe brighter a cloud looks, the less pollution it contains.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFalse\n\n\n\nA given volume of pollution-rich cloud tends to have more numerous and smaller droplets than in more pristine clouds. The high number of small droplets provides more surfaces to reflect light, making the cloud appear brighter than a cloud consisting of fewer and larger droplets.\n\n\n\n\nDo clouds heat or cool Earth?\n\nHeat\nCool\nBoth heat and cool\nNeither heat nor cool\n\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc)\n\n\n\nDifferent kinds of clouds at different altitudes play different roles in regulating Earth’s temperature. Wispy clouds at high altitudes tend to trap infrared radiation emitted by the sun-warmed Earth, which prevents it from escaping into space and warms the atmosphere. On the other hand, thick, low-lying clouds tend to cool the planet by shading Earth’s surface, reflecting sunlight back into space. Scientists are trying to determine how global warming will affect the balance we’ve been enjoying up to now."

Economics also studies the results of these choices and how they affect the society (Frank & Bernanke, 2012)\nSpeaking of economics within conservation science may seem a paradox, because economics is often an obstacle or a limit to the development of conservation strategies and the achievement of conservation goals\nAfter all, we live in a largely capitalistic world, and increasing the capital, which often translates to increasing the bank account, is the goal of most corporations worldwide\nDespite this, thinking like an economist or at least including a few economics notions in the way we think and develop conservation strategies can help to device appropriate conservation actions when resources are lacking or very few\nNo conservation effort or practice can ultimately endure without an intimate connection to value (Dyke & Lamb, 2020)"

A standing stock of mature trees transforms water, sunlight and nutrients from the soil into new biomass and new individuals.

If people are unwilling to pay for a good there will be no profit in its production and in a market no one will invest in it in a substantial way (Daly & Farley, 2011)"

    "text": "While most analysis focus on maintaining steady the supply portion of an ecosystem service, through conservation actions aiming at directly preserving the resource, the authors (Zhao et al., 2018) suggest that quantification of both supply and demand would improve decisions made about both of them.\nBy quantifying the benefits of soil conservation, based on the health of ecosystem services, they could help clarify the economic value of the service to people.\nThe authors focused on both the maximum allowable erosion rate (how much we can use the resource without depleting it out) and the current erosion rate.\nIf the current erosion rate exceeded the maximum there were negative consequences for ecosystem supply. However, if the current erosion were lower than the maximum, the implication for the ecosystem supply were positive.\nProperly developed, environmental markets can stimulate market efficiency and improve overall economic efficiency while supporting higher level of biodiversity conservation.\nTo do this, economists must address externalities, the costs or benefits that are not explicitly captured in a decision or action!"

His administration proposed a new set of rules to calculate CBA and this number was drastically reduced."

Such approaches work with either actual markets or proxy market for property which reflects the various environmental attributes of the property itself.\nStated preference methods ask people how much they are willing to pay for a non-market good or service. Stated preference approaches create hypothetical markets for environmental benefits where there are no current market prices."

We will then try to use some functions from various R packages to compute some of the genetic indexes that we have discussed in the first part of the course\nWe will be using a dataset published by Groombridge, Jones, Bruford, & Nichols (2000)\nThe dataset contains 153 individuals of Kestrel, a small bird of prey, typed at 12 microsatellite loci\nThe dataset is available here as an excel file. Download it and place in a directory of your convenience\nBefore moving forward with the excercise I will review some basic R stuff, including the installation process and how to retrieve some of the most important packages"
