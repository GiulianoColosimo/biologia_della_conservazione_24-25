    "text": "Welcome to class! These web-pages contain all the information you need to accomplish your class work for the teaching module Biologia della Conservazione. This module is part of the integrated course of Evolution and Conservation.\nThis is a mandatory module for master level students enrolled in the “Biologia Ambientale” degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth 5 CFU for a total of 40 hours (i.e., 20 classes of 2 hours each) to be administered in person during the first semester of academic year 2024/2025. The first class will be on Monday, November 4, 2024.\n\n\nThe module introduces students to Conservation Biology, a synthesis and crisis discipline that uses approaches and methods from disciplines such as Ecology, Population biology, Population genetics, Molecular biology, and applies them to the conservation of species, intended as dynamic entities capable to respond to environmental changes. Criteria and principles for the adoption of the different conservation strategies are presented and discussed throughout the course. Moreover, the practical aspects of the various approaches are examined through the study and analysis of real cases, with particular reference to aspects linked to the research lines carried out and coordinated by the teacher.\nTopics covered during the course include: evolutionary genetics of natural populations; loss of genetic variability in small populations; inbreeding and decreased fitness; fragmentation of populations; definition and maintenance of evolutionary potential; population size (\\(N\\) and \\(N_e\\)) and its estimators; resolution of taxonomic uncertainties; genetic management of threatened species; adaptation to captivity; planning of head-start interventions and captive-breeding; the IUCN classification; criteria for conservation: species richness, rare species, endemisms; hotspot analysis; gap analysis; climate change; conservation technology; conservation economics.\n\n\n\nThe course aims at providing students with the most fundamental tools to understand, acknowledge, describe, and address problems related to the conservation of Biodiversity. By the end of the course the students should develop autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents are expected to develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes. Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline through the access to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAttendance is mandatory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead carefully!\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to periodically check this website to make sure he/she has the most updated information about the course schedule and content. The dates for the mid term and final exams will be published on this website later during the course of the semester!"

Yet, humans have always appreciated the importance of preserving the natural environment.\n\n\nPlato (~427—348 b.c.), through the words of Critia, laments the bad conditions of the land that is no longer productive and rich how it used to be (“Crizia,” n.d.).\nJudaism extended the principle of the Sabbath to agricultural land (“La Bibbia—Leviticus 25:4—5,” n.d.).\nDuring the Song dynasty (China, 960—1279 AD) it was common practice to set aside fengshui (sacred) portions of the land, mostly forest, to help regulating spiritual and physical power. Modern china forgo this view.\n\n\n\nThese are all historical examples showing that the notion to manage our natural resources is well known and established in our species. And yet, we continuously seem to fail at conserving them."
