    "text": "Welcome to class! These web-pages contain all the information you need to accomplish your class work for the teaching module Biologia della Conservazione. This module is part of the integrated course of Evolution and Conservation.\nThis is a mandatory module for master level students enrolled in the “Biologia Ambientale” degree at the University of Rome Tor Vergata. It is worth 5 CFU for a total of 40 hours (i.e., 20 classes of 2 hours each) to be administered in person during the first semester of academic year 2024/2025. The first class will be on Monday, November 4, 2024.\n\n\nThe module introduces students to Conservation Biology, a synthesis and crisis discipline that uses approaches and methods from disciplines such as Ecology, Population biology, Population genetics, Molecular biology, and applies them to the conservation of species, intended as dynamic entities capable to respond to environmental changes. Criteria and principles for the adoption of the different conservation strategies are presented and discussed throughout the course. Moreover, the practical aspects of the various approaches are examined through the study and analysis of real cases, with particular reference to aspects linked to the research lines carried out and coordinated by the teacher.\nTopics covered during the course include: evolutionary genetics of natural populations; loss of genetic variability in small populations; inbreeding and decreased fitness; fragmentation of populations; definition and maintenance of evolutionary potential; population size (\\(N\\) and \\(N_e\\)) and its estimators; resolution of taxonomic uncertainties; genetic management of threatened species; adaptation to captivity; planning of head-start interventions and captive-breeding; the IUCN classification; criteria for conservation: species richness, rare species, endemisms; hotspot analysis; gap analysis; climate change; conservation technology; conservation economics.\n\n\n\nThe course aims at providing students with the most fundamental tools to understand, acknowledge, describe, and address problems related to the conservation of Biodiversity. By the end of the course the students should develop autonomy in the process of understanding of different approaches and methods, consolidating the awareness that conservation biology is a crisis discipline that requires specific analytical skills to guide appropriate interventions.\nStudents are expected to develop professional language and communication skills through a continuous interaction with the teacher and interventions during classes. Additionally, students are guided in the understanding of the discipline through the access to primary literature in English. The process of development such skills is monitored by written periodical checks, with open questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAttendance is mandatory!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead carefully!\n\n\n\nIt is a student’s responsibility to periodically check this website to make sure he/she has the most updated information about the course schedule and content. The dates for the mid term and final exams will be published on this website later during the course of the semester!"

    "text": "The origins of conservation\nFor thousands of years humans have managed natural resources, but did not spend much time conserving them. Yet, humans have always appreciated the importance of preserving the natural environment.\n\n\nPlato (~427—348 b.c.), through the words of Critia, laments the bad conditions of the land that is no longer productive and rich how it used to be (“Crizia,” n.d.).\nJudaism extended the principle of the Sabbath to agricultural land (“La Bibbia—Leviticus 25:4—5,” n.d.).\nDuring the Song dynasty (China, 960—1279 AD) it was common practice to set aside fengshui (sacred) portions of the land, mostly forest, to help regulating spiritual and physical power. Modern china forgo this view.\n\n\n\nThese are all historical examples showing that the notion to manage our natural resources is well known and established in our species. And yet, we continuously seem to fail at conserving them."

This occurs when a complex entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and emerge only when they interact in a wider whole (Wikipedia contributors, 2024)\n\n\n\n\nBiodiversity is essential for food security and nutrition and offers key options for sustainable livelihoods (Convention on Biological Diversity, https://www.cbd.int)"

Algae blooming consumed vast amounts of oxygen in the oceans, suffocating many species.\nPermian-Triassic. 96% of life lost. Volcanic activity in Siberia put out massive amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bacteria began producing methane, another greenhouse gas. Large quantities of both gases warmed the planet and combined with earth’s water, making the ocean and rain acidic, creating a highly toxic environment for life.\nTriassic-Jurassic. 80% of life lost.

(Ordovician-Silurian 86%; Late Devonian 75%; Permian-Triassic 96%; Triassic-Jurassic 80%; Cretaceous. 65%; current number of species approx. 2.16 M; average life span for a species is 5 MY).\n\n\n. . .\n\n100-((1*0.86)+(1*0.75)+(1*0.96)+(1*0.80)+(1*0.65))\n\n[1] 95.98\n\n\n. . .\n\nThis means that 100% - 4% = 96% of all extinctions occurred outside the mass extinction events.\n\n. . .\n\nThe results from this little exercise are not so distant from what has been known in the scientific literature (Raup, 1991).\n\n. . .\n\nThese results tell us that extinction is a natural process.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf extinction is part of the natural process of evolution it should be possible to identify a background-extinction rate, i.e. the natural extinction rate during periods in between major extinction events.\nIf we can estimate a background-extinction rate it should also be possible to compare it across time to measure our current impact on biodiversity.\nThe value we just used (~5-10 MY) per species is a good approximation of the background extinction rate (Lawton & May, 1995) and falls under the categories of extinction rate intended as species survival rate.\nAnother way used to estimate extinction rate is based on the species-area estimate (Chisholm et al., 2018).\nOne of the estimate of extinction rate largely used is in million species years (MSY, Pimm, Raven, Peterson, Çağan, & Ehrlich, 2006).\n\n\n\nThe million species year extinction rate is based on the empirical estimate from known data on current extinction.\nIt tells us how many extinctions we should expect in any sample where the sum of all of the years over all of the species under consideration is one million.\nFor example, follow the fates of 10,000 bird species for one century and one should observe just one extinction (i.e., 1 E/MSY according to Pimm et al., 2006).\n\n. . .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion!\n\n\n\n1230 species of birds have been described since 1900. This cohort has accumulated 98334 species-years, meaning that one species has been known for 80 years. Since their description, 13 have gone extinct. Can you estimate the extinction rate?\n\n\n. . .\n\n(13*10^6)/98334\n\n[1] 132.2025\n\n\n. . .\nThis means that the rates of extinctions in recent times (at least since we can document extinctions as they happen) seems to be dramatically increased [1]!\n\n\nThe core idea is to find a background extinction rate that doesn’t consider the influence of mass-extinction events and/or anthropic influence.\nWe know from fossil records that species seem to persist ~1 MY. Pimm, Russell, Gittleman, & Brooks (1995) take the fossil evidence and turn it into a background extinction rate (i.e, a ratio between two quantities, the number of species extinct over time-species). In particular, 1 extinction (E) per \\(10^6\\) species-years (MSY).\n\n. . .\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{10000}=\\frac{1}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{1}{10^6}*10000;\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 0.01\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{98334}=\\frac{x}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{13}{98334}*10^6;\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 132.202\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\frac{191}{100000}=\\frac{x}{10^6};\n\\]\n\\[\nx = \\frac{191}{10^5}*10^6;\n\\]\n\\[\nx=1910\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overarching driver of species extinction is human population growth and per-capita consumption!\n\n1690 Dodo bird (Raphus cucullatus), extinct from predation by introduced pigs and cats.\n1768 Stellar’s sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), extinct from hunting for fur and oil.\n1870 Labrador duck (Camptorhynchus labradorius), extinct from human competition for mussels and other shellfish.\n1900 Rocky mountain locust (Melanoplus spretus), extinct from habitat conversion to farmland.\n1936 Tasmanian wolf (Thylacinus cynocephalus), extinct from hunting, habitat loss, and competition with dogs.\n1952 Deepwater cisco fish (Coregonus johannae), extinct from competition and predation by introduced fishes.\n\n\n\n1962 Hawaii chaff flower (Achyranthes atollensis), extinct from habitat conversion to military installations.\n1989 Golden toad (Incilius periglenes), extinct from climate change or other impacts.\n2004 St. Helena olive tree (Nesiota elliptica), extinct from logging and plantations.\n\n(List available from the Smithsonian website.)\n\n\n\nA documented example of the impact of introduced species on island environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Smith, May, Pellew, Johnson, & Walter (1993).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Conservation Biology?\nNature conservation: priority-setting needs a global change"
